# Implementation: Many-to-Many Coach-Member Relationships

## Date
2024 - Session 13 (Final Phase)

## Problem Statement
User requested: "now on the coach side work on adding drop down of all members to add to a coach, we can un assign a coach, and the relationship is many to many"

### Requirements
1. Allow coaches to have multiple members assigned
2. Allow members to have multiple coaches assigned
3. Ability to assign members to coaches
4. Ability to unassign members from coaches
5. Display currently assigned members with remove buttons
6. Display available members to add

## Previous State
- **One-to-Many Relationship**: Each member could only have ONE coach
- **Storage**: `coach_id` column in `wp_jgk_members` table
- **Method**: Used `JuniorGolfKenya_User_Manager::assign_coach()`
- **Limitation**: No way to assign multiple coaches to one member

## Solution Design

### 1. Database Schema - Junction Table
Created `wp_jgk_coach_members` table to handle many-to-many relationships:

```sql
CREATE TABLE wp_jgk_coach_members (
    id bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    coach_id bigint(20) NOT NULL,
    member_id bigint(20) NOT NULL,
    assigned_date datetime NOT NULL,
    assigned_by bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
    notes text,
    is_primary tinyint(1) DEFAULT 0,
    status varchar(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    UNIQUE KEY coach_member_unique (coach_id, member_id),
    KEY idx_coach (coach_id),
    KEY idx_member (member_id)
);
```

**Key Features**:
- `UNIQUE KEY (coach_id, member_id)` prevents duplicate assignments
- `is_primary` flag allows marking one coach as primary
- `status` field ('active', 'inactive') for soft deletes
- `assigned_by` tracks who made the assignment
- Indexes on both foreign keys for fast lookups

**Created via**: `create_coach_members_table.php` script
**Status**: ✅ Table created successfully (no existing assignments migrated)

### 2. Backend PHP Implementation

#### File: `admin/partials/juniorgolfkenya-admin-coaches.php`

##### A. Assign Members Action (Lines 132-145)
**OLD CODE** (one-to-many):
```php
case 'assign_members':
    $coach_id = intval($_POST['coach_id']);
    $member_ids = isset($_POST['member_ids']) ? array_map('intval', $_POST['member_ids']) : array();
    
    $success_count = 0;
    foreach ($member_ids as $member_id) {
        if (JuniorGolfKenya_User_Manager::assign_coach($member_id, $coach_id)) {
            $success_count++;
        }
    }
    
    $message = "Assigned {$success_count} member(s) to coach successfully!";
    $message_type = 'success';
    break;
```

**NEW CODE** (many-to-many):
```php
case 'assign_members':
    $coach_id = intval($_POST['coach_id']);
    $member_ids = isset($_POST['member_ids']) ? array_map('intval', $_POST['member_ids']) : array();
    
    global $wpdb;
    $table = $wpdb->prefix . 'jgk_coach_members';
    $current_user_id = get_current_user_id();
    
    $success_count = 0;
    foreach ($member_ids as $member_id) {
        // Check if already assigned
        $exists = $wpdb->get_var($wpdb->prepare(
            "SELECT id FROM {$table} WHERE coach_id = %d AND member_id = %d",
            $coach_id, $member_id
        ));
        
        if (!$exists) {
            $inserted = $wpdb->insert($table, array(
                'coach_id' => $coach_id,
                'member_id' => $member_id,
                'assigned_date' => current_time('mysql'),
                'assigned_by' => $current_user_id,
                'status' => 'active'
            ));
            
            if ($inserted) {
                $success_count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    $message = "Assigned {$success_count} member(s) to coach successfully!";
    $message_type = 'success';
    break;
```

**Changes**:
- ✅ Direct INSERT into junction table instead of calling `assign_coach()`
- ✅ Checks for existing assignment before inserting (prevents duplicates)
- ✅ Stores `assigned_by` for audit trail
- ✅ Stores `assigned_date` for tracking
- ✅ Sets `status` to 'active'

##### B. Remove Member Action (Lines 147-164) - NEW
```php
case 'remove_member':
    $coach_id = intval($_POST['coach_id']);
    $member_id = intval($_POST['member_id']);
    
    global $wpdb;
    $table = $wpdb->prefix . 'jgk_coach_members';
    
    $deleted = $wpdb->delete($table, array(
        'coach_id' => $coach_id,
        'member_id' => $member_id
    ));
    
    if ($deleted) {
        $message = "Member removed from coach successfully!";
        $message_type = 'success';
    } else {
        $message = "Failed to remove member from coach.";
        $message_type = 'error';
    }
    break;
```

**Purpose**:
- Allows unassigning a member from a coach
- Deletes the relationship from junction table
- Returns success/error message

### 3. Frontend HTML Implementation

#### File: `admin/partials/juniorgolfkenya-admin-coaches.php` (Lines 403-470)

##### A. Modal Structure Changes
**OLD MODAL**:
- Title: "Assign Members to Coach"
- Single section with checkboxes
- Filtered members: Only showed members with NO coach
- Button: "Assign Members"

**NEW MODAL**:
```html
<div id="assign-modal" class="jgk-modal" style="max-width: 800px;">
    <div class="jgk-modal-content">
        <div class="jgk-modal-header">
            <h2>Manage Members for Coach: <span id="assign-coach-name"></span></h2>
            <span class="jgk-modal-close">&times;</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="jgk-modal-body">
            <!-- SECTION 1: Currently Assigned Members -->
            <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                <h3>Currently Assigned Members</h3>
                <div id="current-members-list">
                    <p style="color: #999; font-style: italic;">Loading...</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <!-- SECTION 2: Add New Members -->
            <div>
                <h3>Add New Members</h3>
                <form method="post" action="">
                    <?php wp_nonce_field('jgk_coach_action'); ?>
                    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="assign_members">
                    <input type="hidden" name="coach_id" id="assign-coach-id">
                    
                    <div class="member-checkboxes">
                        <?php foreach ($all_members as $member): ?>
                            <?php if (in_array($member->status, ['approved', 'pending', 'active'])): ?>
                                <label>
                                    <input type="checkbox" name="member_ids[]" 
                                           value="<?php echo esc_attr($member->id); ?>"
                                           class="member-checkbox"
                                           data-member-id="<?php echo esc_attr($member->id); ?>">
                                    <?php echo esc_html($member->first_name . ' ' . $member->last_name); ?>
                                    (<?php echo esc_html($member->membership_type); ?>)
                                </label>
                            <?php endif; ?>
                        <?php endforeach; ?>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="jgk-modal-footer">
                        <button type="submit" class="button button-primary">Add Selected Members</button>
                        <button type="button" class="button jgk-modal-close-btn">Cancel</button>
                    </div>
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ Two-section layout: "Currently Assigned Members" + "Add New Members"
- ✅ Modal width increased to 800px
- ✅ Title changed to "Manage Members for Coach"
- ✅ Placeholder div `#current-members-list` for dynamic loading
- ✅ Removed filter: Now shows ALL active/pending members (not just members with no coach)
- ✅ Added `data-member-id` attribute to checkboxes
- ✅ Button text: "Add Selected Members" instead of "Assign Members"

### 4. JavaScript Implementation

#### File: `admin/partials/juniorgolfkenya-admin-coaches.php` (Lines ~560-630)

##### A. Open Modal Function (Lines 560-575)
```javascript
function openAssignModal(coachId, coachName) {
    document.getElementById('assign-coach-id').value = coachId;
    document.getElementById('assign-coach-name').textContent = coachName;
    
    // Load currently assigned members
    loadAssignedMembers(coachId);
    
    // Uncheck all checkboxes
    document.querySelectorAll('.member-checkbox').forEach(cb => cb.checked = false);
    
    document.getElementById('assign-modal').style.display = 'block';
}
```

**Changes**:
- ✅ Calls `loadAssignedMembers(coachId)` to fetch current assignments
- ✅ Unchecks all checkboxes before opening
- ✅ Sets coach ID and name

##### B. Load Assigned Members Function (Lines 577-630) - NEW
```javascript
function loadAssignedMembers(coachId) {
    const container = document.getElementById('current-members-list');
    container.innerHTML = '<p style="color: #999; font-style: italic;">Loading...</p>';
    
    // Make AJAX call to get assigned members
    fetch('<?php echo admin_url('admin-ajax.php'); ?>', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
        },
        body: 'action=jgk_get_coach_members&coach_id=' + coachId + 
              '&_wpnonce=<?php echo wp_create_nonce('jgk_coach_members'); ?>'
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        if (data.success && data.data.members.length > 0) {
            let html = '<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 5px;">';
            data.data.members.forEach(member => {
                html += `
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; 
                                padding: 5px; background: #f9f9f9; border-radius: 3px;">
                        <span>
                            <strong>${member.name}</strong> 
                            <span style="color: #666; font-size: 11px;">(${member.membership_type})</span>
                            ${member.is_primary ? '<span style="color: #46b450; font-size: 11px;">★ Primary</span>' : ''}
                        </span>
                        <button type="button" class="button button-small" 
                                onclick="removeMember(${coachId}, ${member.id}, '${member.name}')" 
                                style="color: #d63638;">
                            Remove
                        </button>
                    </div>
                `;
                
                // Disable checkbox for already assigned members
                const checkbox = document.querySelector(`.member-checkbox[data-member-id="${member.id}"]`);
                if (checkbox) {
                    checkbox.disabled = true;
                    checkbox.parentElement.style.opacity = '0.5';
                    checkbox.parentElement.innerHTML += ' <span style="color: #46b450; font-size: 11px;">✓ Already assigned</span>';
                }
            });
            html += '</div>';
            container.innerHTML = html;
        } else {
            container.innerHTML = '<p style="color: #999; font-style: italic;">No members currently assigned to this coach.</p>';
        }
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error loading members:', error);
        container.innerHTML = '<p style="color: #d63638;">Error loading members. Please try again.</p>';
    });
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Shows loading message while fetching
- ✅ Fetches assigned members via AJAX (`jgk_get_coach_members` action)
- ✅ Displays member name, membership type, and primary status
- ✅ Adds "Remove" button for each member
- ✅ Disables checkboxes for already assigned members
- ✅ Shows "✓ Already assigned" label
- ✅ Handles empty state and errors
- ✅ Security: Uses nonce verification

##### C. Remove Member Function (Lines 632-650) - NEW
```javascript
function removeMember(coachId, memberId, memberName) {
    if (!confirm(`Are you sure you want to remove ${memberName} from this coach?`)) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Create hidden form and submit
    const form = document.createElement('form');
    form.method = 'POST';
    form.innerHTML = `
        <?php wp_nonce_field('jgk_coach_action'); ?>
        <input type="hidden" name="action" value="remove_member">
        <input type="hidden" name="coach_id" value="${coachId}">
        <input type="hidden" name="member_id" value="${memberId}">
    `;
    document.body.appendChild(form);
    form.submit();
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Confirmation dialog before removing
- ✅ Creates hidden form with POST data
- ✅ Includes nonce for security
- ✅ Submits to `remove_member` action
- ✅ Page refreshes after removal to show updated state

### 5. AJAX Endpoint Implementation

#### File: `juniorgolfkenya.php` (Lines ~100-165)

```php
/**
 * Register AJAX handler for getting coach members
 */
add_action('wp_ajax_jgk_get_coach_members', 'jgk_ajax_get_coach_members');

function jgk_ajax_get_coach_members() {
    // Verify nonce
    if (!isset($_POST['_wpnonce']) || !wp_verify_nonce($_POST['_wpnonce'], 'jgk_coach_members')) {
        wp_send_json_error(array('message' => 'Security check failed'));
    }
    
    // Check permissions
    if (!current_user_can('manage_coaches')) {
        wp_send_json_error(array('message' => 'Insufficient permissions'));
    }
    
    $coach_id = isset($_POST['coach_id']) ? intval($_POST['coach_id']) : 0;
    
    if (!$coach_id) {
        wp_send_json_error(array('message' => 'Invalid coach ID'));
    }
    
    global $wpdb;
    $members_table = $wpdb->prefix . 'jgk_members';
    $junction_table = $wpdb->prefix . 'jgk_coach_members';
    
    // Get assigned members with their details
    $query = $wpdb->prepare("
        SELECT 
            m.id,
            m.first_name,
            m.last_name,
            m.membership_type,
            cm.is_primary,
            cm.assigned_date
        FROM {$junction_table} cm
        INNER JOIN {$members_table} m ON cm.member_id = m.id
        WHERE cm.coach_id = %d AND cm.status = 'active'
        ORDER BY cm.is_primary DESC, cm.assigned_date DESC
    ", $coach_id);
    
    $results = $wpdb->get_results($query);
    
    $members = array();
    foreach ($results as $row) {
        $members[] = array(
            'id' => $row->id,
            'name' => $row->first_name . ' ' . $row->last_name,
            'membership_type' => $row->membership_type,
            'is_primary' => (bool) $row->is_primary,
            'assigned_date' => $row->assigned_date
        );
    }
    
    wp_send_json_success(array('members' => $members));
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Registered as WordPress AJAX action: `wp_ajax_jgk_get_coach_members`
- ✅ Nonce verification for security
- ✅ Permission check: `manage_coaches` capability
- ✅ Validates coach ID
- ✅ Joins junction table with members table
- ✅ Filters by coach_id and status='active'
- ✅ Orders by is_primary first, then assigned_date
- ✅ Returns JSON with member details
- ✅ Includes primary coach indicator

## Implementation Summary

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Assign Multiple Members
1. Navigate to Coaches page
2. Click "Assign Members" on a coach
3. Select multiple members from checkboxes
4. Click "Add Selected Members"
5. ✅ Verify page reloads with success message

2. Assign Member A to Coach 2
3. ✅ Verify Member A appears in both coaches' assigned lists
4. ✅ Verify no errors or conflicts

### 4. Test Duplicate Prevention
1. Assign Member B to Coach 1
2. Try to assign Member B to Coach 1 again
3. ✅ Verify checkbox is disabled with "✓ Already assigned" label
4. ✅ Verify no duplicate entry created in junction table

### 5. Test AJAX Loading
1. Open modal for coach with 5+ assigned members
2. ✅ Verify "Loading..." message appears briefly
3. ✅ Verify list populates with all assigned members
4. ✅ Verify primary coach shows ★ indicator
5. ✅ Verify membership types display correctly

### 6. Test Error Handling

2. Open modal
3. ✅ Verify error message: "Error loading members. Please try again."

### 7. Test Empty State
1. Create new coach with no assigned members
2. Open modal
3. ✅ Verify message: "No members currently assigned to this coach."

## Database Verification Queries

### Check Junction Table Structure
```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE wp_jgk_coach_members;
```

### Check Assigned Members for Coach ID 1
```sql
SELECT 
    cm.id,
    cm.coach_id,
    cm.member_id,
    m.first_name,
    m.last_name,
    cm.is_primary,
    cm.status,
    cm.assigned_date
FROM wp_jgk_coach_members cm
INNER JOIN wp_jgk_members m ON cm.member_id = m.id
WHERE cm.coach_id = 1
ORDER BY cm.is_primary DESC, cm.assigned_date DESC;
```

### Count Coaches per Member
```sql
SELECT 
    m.id,
    m.first_name,
    m.last_name,
    COUNT(cm.coach_id) as coach_count
FROM wp_jgk_members m
LEFT JOIN wp_jgk_coach_members cm ON m.id = cm.member_id AND cm.status = 'active'
GROUP BY m.id
HAVING coach_count > 1
ORDER BY coach_count DESC;
```

### Find Duplicate Assignments (Should be empty)
```sql
SELECT coach_id, member_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM wp_jgk_coach_members
GROUP BY coach_id, member_id
HAVING count > 1;
```

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Old `coach_id` column in `wp_jgk_members` table is RETAINED
- ✅ Can be used to designate "primary coach" concept
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing member data

### Future Enhancements
1. **Set Primary Coach**: Add button to mark one coach as primary
2. **Bulk Assignment**: Select all members from a filter
3. **Unassign All**: Remove all members from a coach at once
4. **Assignment History**: Track when members were added/removed
5. **Email Notifications**: Notify coach/member when assignment changes
6. **Coach Notes**: Add notes field in modal for why member was assigned
