## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Privacy-First Design
- ✅ **Default:** All members hidden (0)
- ✅ **Opt-in:** Admin must explicitly make public
- ✅ **Control:** Only admins can change visibility
- ✅ **Safe:** Only active members with `is_public=1` shown

### GDPR Compliance
- ✅ Members hidden by default
- ✅ Easy to remove from public view
- ✅ No sensitive data in public gallery
- ✅ Admin-controlled consent

### Who Can See What?

| Viewer | Hidden Members | Public Members |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Public | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Members | ❌ No* | ✅ Yes |
| Coaches | ✅ Yes (assigned) | ✅ Yes |
| Admins | ✅ Yes (all) | ✅ Yes |

*Members can only see their own profile regardless of visibility setting.

## 📊 SQL Quick Reference

### Count Public vs Hidden
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN is_public = 1 THEN 'PUBLIC' ELSE 'HIDDEN' END as visibility,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM wp_jgk_members
GROUP BY is_public;
```

### See All Public Members
```sql
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, status, is_public
FROM wp_jgk_members
WHERE is_public = 1
ORDER BY first_name;
```

### Make Member Public (by ID)
```sql
UPDATE wp_jgk_members
SET is_public = 1
WHERE id = 123;
```

### Make All Active Members with Photos Public

SET is_public = 1
WHERE status = 'active'
AND profile_image_id IS NOT NULL;
```
