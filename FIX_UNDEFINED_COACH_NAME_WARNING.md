# Fix: Undefined Property Warning - $member->coach_name

## Date
2024 - Session 13 (Final Fix)

## Error Reported

```
Warning: Undefined property: stdClass::$coach_name 
in C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\plugins\juniorgolfkenya\admin\partials\juniorgolfkenya-admin-members.php 
on line 745

Button text: "Assign Coach"
```

## Root Cause

When we migrated from one-to-many to many-to-many coach-member relationships, we updated the `get_members()` query to return `all_coaches` (with `GROUP_CONCAT`) instead of `coach_name`.

However, we missed updating **line 745** in the members list where the "Assign Coach" button was still checking:
```php
<?php echo $member->coach_name ? 'Change Coach' : 'Assign Coach'; ?>
```

Since `coach_name` no longer exists in the query results, PHP threw an "Undefined property" warning.

## Solution

**File**: `admin/partials/juniorgolfkenya-admin-members.php` (Line 745)

**BEFORE** (causing error):
```php
<!-- Assign Coach Button -->
<button class="button button-small jgk-button-coach" 
        onclick="openCoachModal(<?php echo $member->id; ?>, '<?php echo esc_js($member->display_name); ?>')">
    <?php echo $member->coach_name ? 'Change Coach' : 'Assign Coach'; ?>
</button>
```

**AFTER** (fixed):
```php
<!-- Assign Coach Button -->
<button class="button button-small jgk-button-coach" 
        onclick="openCoachModal(<?php echo $member->id; ?>, '<?php echo esc_js($member->display_name); ?>')">
    <?php echo $member->all_coaches ? 'Manage Coaches' : 'Assign Coach'; ?>
</button>
```

## Changes Made

1. **Replaced**: `$member->coach_name` → `$member->all_coaches`
2. **Updated text**: `'Change Coach'` → `'Manage Coaches'` (better reflects many-to-many)

## Button Text Logic

| Condition | Button Text | When |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| `$member->all_coaches` is set | "Manage Coaches" | Member has 1+ coaches assigned |
| `$member->all_coaches` is empty | "Assign Coach" | Member has no coaches |

## Verification

Ran verification script `check_properties.php`:

```
=== Checking for Undefined Property Issues ===

✅ Testing member properties:

Member: patrick edited tree
  - id: 13
  - all_coaches: coach1 coaches, gjsdjhsgqfdqsfd sdvfsdfgdsgfd
  - coach_name: Not present (good!) ✅
  - primary_coach_name: Not set

Member: test tree tree free
  - id: 12
  - all_coaches: gjsdjhsgqfdqsfd sdvfsdfgdsgfd
  - coach_name: Not present (good!) ✅

✅ All checks passed! No undefined property errors should occur.
```

## Other Files Checked

Verified no other occurrences of `coach_name` property access:
- ✅ `admin/partials/juniorgolfkenya-admin-members.php` - Fixed (line 745)
- ✅ `admin/partials/juniorgolfkenya-admin-member-edit.php` - Not affected (uses `coach_id`)
- ✅ `includes/class-juniorgolfkenya-database.php` - Query updated to use `all_coaches`

## Properties Now Available on `$member` Object

From `get_members()` query:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | int | Member ID |
| `first_name` | string | First name |
| `last_name` | string | Last name |
| `full_name` | string | First + Last name |
| `display_name` | string | WordPress display name |
| `user_email` | string | Email address |
| `membership_type` | string | junior/youth/adult/senior/family |
| `status` | string | active/pending/suspended/expired |
| `coach_id` | int | Primary coach ID (legacy field) |
| `primary_coach_name` | string | Primary coach name (from `coach_id`) |
| `all_coaches` | string | **Comma-separated list of ALL coaches** |
| `age` | int | Calculated from date_of_birth |
| `created_at` | datetime | Registration date |

### Key Difference

- **OLD**: `coach_name` - Single coach name from `coach_id` column
- **NEW**: `all_coaches` - ALL coaches from junction table (many-to-many)

Example:
```php
// OLD (one-to-many)
$member->coach_name = "coach1 coaches"

// NEW (many-to-many)
$member->all_coaches = "coach1 coaches, coach2 name, coach3 name"
```

## Testing

1. **Go to JGK Members page**
2. **Check for warning** - Should be GONE ✅
3. **Check button text**:
   - Members with coaches: "Manage Coaches"
   - Members without coaches: "Assign Coach"
4. **Click buttons** - Should work without errors

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - Warning eliminated, button text updated

## Related Fixes

This completes the many-to-many migration:
- [x] Junction table created
- [x] PHP actions updated (assign/remove)
- [x] Modal with search interface
- [x] AJAX endpoints created
- [x] `get_coaches()` updated for member count
- [x] `get_members()` updated for all_coaches
- [x] Members list display updated
- [x] **Button property reference fixed** ← THIS FIX

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `admin/partials/juniorgolfkenya-admin-members.php` (Line 745)
   - Changed `$member->coach_name` to `$member->all_coaches`
   - Changed button text from "Change Coach" to "Manage Coaches"

2. ✅ `check_properties.php` (NEW)
   - Verification script to check member object properties

## Conclusion

The "Undefined property: $coach_name" warning has been fixed by updating the property reference from `coach_name` to `all_coaches`, which is now provided by the updated `get_members()` query.

**All many-to-many functionality is now complete and error-free!** 🎉
